# TCP Server in Go

A simple TCP server implemented in Go, designed to accept multiple client connections, read incoming messages, and respond dynamically.

This project was built to practice client-server networking concepts and to demonstrate Goâ€™s concurrency model using Goroutines and channels.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

- `main.go` â€” Entry point; starts the server.
- `server.go` â€” Server logic: listening, accepting connections, reading data.
- `message.go` â€” Definition of the `Message` struct.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tcp-server.git
   cd tcp-server
2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   go run .
3. Connect to the server using telnet:
   ```bash
   telnet localhost 3000
4. Type a message and press Enter â€” the server will respond.

## ðŸ›  Features
- Accepts multiple simultaneous client connections.
- Reads full messages until newline (\n).
- Replies with a thank-you message to each client.
- Uses channels to safely communicate between Goroutines.
- Clean modular structure with Go best practices.

## ðŸ’¬ Example Interaction
```ruby
$ telnet localhost 3000
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Hello server!
Thank you for your message!
```

## ðŸ“š Technologies Used
- Go (Golang)
- TCP networking (net package)
- Goroutines
- Channels

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Understand TCP server-client architecture.
- Practice concurrency and safe communication in Go.
- Structure Go projects into modular, maintainable files.
